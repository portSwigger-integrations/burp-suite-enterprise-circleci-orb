  Below is an example of how to use the orb by running a Burp scan against our very own Gin and Juice Shop (https://ginandjuice.shop) site.
  This is a deliberately vulnerable web application designed for testing web vulnerability scanners.
  To use an environment variable for the API key pass the variable name as a parameter within ${} (see line 12).

    basic-scan:
      machine:
        image: ubuntu-2204:current
      resource_class: medium
      steps:
