  Burp Suite Enterprise Edition produces a JUnit XML report of the scan on completion. This report will only include vulnerability details if vulnerabilities were found by the scanner.
  By default, if Burp scanner finds any issue with a severity level of at least LOW and confidence at least TENTATIVE, the workflow will fail.
  The examples below show how to display the vulnerability report in the Tests tab, or to store the raw .xml report as an artifact.
